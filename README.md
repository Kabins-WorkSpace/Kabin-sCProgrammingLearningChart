# Kabin-sCProgrammingLearningChart

##Why this repository?<br>
<br>
I started relearning the basic concepts of C again with the help of my favourite teacher Mr. Bharat Acharya through his learning platform Bharat Acharya Education. I always felt ashamed about the fact that I didn't manage to learn these basic concepts despite having the goal of being a programmer since I was 12 year old even when I spent 4 years becoming a Computer Engineer. This realisation killed me from inside every single day and that is why I decided to not care about anything else and get the basics right. And that is what I've been doing for the past 1 year. This included a learning curve where I delved deeper into C as well as Java along with other development tools like GitHub. In this repository, I am trying to combine my learnings of both C and GitHub so forgive me if you find this repository to be too basic and bland. Still, I'll try my best to make it as effective as I can.

##Contents of this repository<br>
<br>
This repository will contain all the basic concepts of C ranging from extremely basic such as naming variables and creating loops to slightly intermediate concepts such as Pointers, Linked Lists and simple algorithms like Binary Search and Selection Sort.
